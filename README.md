Greeting! I am Willy

**Roland** is my first independent project, which allows users to have conversations, share information and create group event content. It uses a "double opt-in" system where both users must have "swiped right" the card to match before they can create a chat room and exchange messages.


# About Roland ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-v1.0.0-blue)

We think Roland will help you create a beautiful, wonderful life, with your confident, and open mind.


### Beautiful user experiences

We want to enable users to make new friends here without being worried. We seek those people who have the curiosity to exploring through the world and try to start a new relationship. Roland includes two features, first is "swiped cards" as many apps in the world. You can easily find the person you might be interested in the first impressions when the card which contents that person's info. After you "swiped right" the card just wait for Jupiter to do his job. If You notice there is a new chat room showing up which means you both have an interest in each other. Second, "group event" is any creative event all you can find it here, this feature lets people can create and join an event.

# Requirements 

* iOS 13 or later

* only support `light mode`

* Highly recommended using mobile device cause we only `support iPhone screen size`


# Technic We used

* Follows MVC architecture, making the project easy to maintain

* Supports Sign in with Apple and FirebaseAuth, not only managed account database but also protected user privacy

* Saved user’s data and images through Firebase Cloud Firestore and Storage

* Conforms to OOP, keeping the project be reusability, safety, and flexibility

* Handles data with cache mechanism, reducing RAM usage and significantly increasing app performance

* Uses DateFormatter to check the time comparison for group event feature, comments, and messages

* Uses UIPanGestureRecognizer to control the swiping angle of cards, and determine the matching result
